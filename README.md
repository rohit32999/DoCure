### üí≠Inspiration

‚Ä¢ Efficiency and Streamlining: Traditional paper-based and manual systems for managing hospital operations are often inefficient and prone to errors. Developing an HMS web application aims to streamline administrative tasks, automate workflows, and improve overall operational efficiency. <br>

‚Ä¢ Scalability and accessibility: A Hospital Management System provides scalability and accessibility benefits, allowing healthcare institutions to easily scale their operations, accommodate growth, and provide remote access to authorized personnel, including healthcare providers (doctors), administrators, and patients.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### üéØUse Case 
Imagine there is a public health crisis or emergency, such as a natural disaster, pandemic, or mass casualty event. In such situations, hospitals experience a surge in patient volume and complexity, requiring efficient management of resources, streamlined communication, and rapid decision-making to ensure the delivery of timely and effective care. An Hospital Management system website becomes indispensable as it provides a centralized platform for managing patient records, coordinating clinical workflows, scheduling appointments, tracking inventory and supplies, and communicating critical information among healthcare providers, administrators, and patients. Additionally, the system's ability to generate real-time reports and analytics enables hospitals to assess and adapt their response strategies swiftly, allocate resources effectively, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards amidst the chaos of a crisis.

### üí°What problem does the project solve?
‚Ä¢  By maintaining accurate and up-to-date patient records, HMS websites facilitate better coordination among healthcare providers, ensuring that patients receive timely and appropriate care. <br>
‚Ä¢ Through features like online appointment scheduling, access to medical records, and patient portals, Our websites empowe patients to take a more active role in managing their healthcare, leading to improved satisfaction and engagement. <br>
‚Ä¢  With functionalities like electronic health records, electronic prescribing and tele-health services, Our website improve the efficiency of clinical workflows, reducing paperwork and enabling faster access to patient information. <br>
‚Ä¢ Our website automate and streamline administrative tasks such as patient registration, appointment scheduling and inventory management, reducing manual errors and saving time for staff. <br>


### üôåOverview 
‚Ä¢	On the landing page of DoCure, we can see the buttons "Get free consultation" and "Book an appointment".

‚Ä¢	Clicking on the button will take you to our dashboard, where there is a hierarchial way for admins and users to go through the website.

‚Ä¢	Start interacting with the website, using features of our various services, appointments, patient portals, health records, etc.

‚Ä¢	Online video conferencing is also available for bedridden and emergency patients.


### üíÄChallenges we Faced:
‚Ä¢	Creating the ML model was difficult for us because of the unavailability of any concrete data set.

‚Ä¢ Connecting the backend to the database was a bit complex!

‚Ä¢	Integrating the video conferencing app to our project took a bit of time.

‚Ä¢	In the absense of a full time designer, we were in a fix regarding the UI of our project.


 
### üîÆFuture Goals:
‚Ä¢ We have planned to make our application available for the governmemt aided hospitals in order to ease their daily medical proceedings and improve timely and scheduled patient-doctor appointments. 

‚Ä¢ Optimisation and minor bug fixes.<br>
